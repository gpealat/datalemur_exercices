## Problem
A fair die is rolled repeatedly until a number larger than 4 is observed.

What's the probability that it takes you 4 rolls to roll a number greater than 4?

## Solution

Probability to have a number smaller or equal to 4

$\frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3}$

Probability to have a number greater than 4

$\frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}$

Probability to have 4 rolls to get a number greater than 4
$(\frac{2}{3})^3 * \frac{1}{3} = \frac{8}{81}$
