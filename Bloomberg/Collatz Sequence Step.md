## Problem
Given a positive integer n, the Collatz sequence for n is generated by repeatedly applying the following operations:

If n is even, then 
n = n / 2

If n is odd, then 
n=3âˆ—n+1

Repeat the above steps until n becomes 1.

## Solution

    def recurs(n, i):
      ''' Recursive function '''
      if (n%2) == 0:
        n=n/2
      else:
        n=3*n+1
      i=i+1

      if n > 1:
          n,i = recurs(n,i)
    
      return n,i

    def collatzSteps(n):
      i=0
      if n == 1:
          return i
      
      n,i = recurs(n,i)
      return i
